    <h1>Instant Pot Naan Bread</h1>

    <div class="ingredients">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted ghee or butter</li>
            <li>Garlic (optional, for garlic naan), finely chopped</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Allow it to sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
            <li>Prepare the dough: In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture, yogurt, and melted ghee/butter. Mix everything until it forms a soft dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Rise the dough: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat the Instant Pot: Turn on the Instant Pot and select the "Yogurt" setting. Allow it to preheat for a couple of minutes and then turn it off.</li>
            <li>Divide and shape the dough: Once risen, punch down the dough and divide it into 6-8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and flatten slightly with your hands.</li>
            <li>Cooking the naan: Lightly flour the working surface. Roll out each dough portion into an oval or round shape, about 1/4 inch thick. Optionally, sprinkle chopped garlic onto the rolled-out dough and press it in. Brush the Instant Pot's inner pot with a little ghee or oil. Place one rolled-out naan into the preheated Instant Pot. Close the lid and let it cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Finishing touches: After 2 minutes, carefully open the lid. The naan should have puffed up and have some brown spots. Using tongs, carefully remove the naan from the Instant Pot and brush the top with a little more melted ghee or butter. Optionally, sprinkle chopped cilantro leaves over the naan for added flavor.</li>
            <li>Repeat for remaining dough: Repeat the process with the remaining dough portions.</li>
            <li>Serve warm: Serve the naan warm with your favorite curries, dips, or as a side to any meal.</li>
        </ol>
