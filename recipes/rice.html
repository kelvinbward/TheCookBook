  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>1 cup white Jasmine rice</ul>
  <ul>1 cup water or broth</ul>
  <ul>1/2 teaspoon salt *reduce if using broth</ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>Place dry rice in a large mesh strainer and rinse thoroughly under cold water for a couple of minutes, stirring the rice while rinsing to ensure all grains are clean.</ol>
  <ol>Place rinsed rice in a 6 quart Instant Pot (*double the recipe if making in an 8 quart to ensure enough liquid is used) and add water or broth and salt.</ol>
  <ol>Spread rice into an even layer on the bottom of the Instant Pot.</ol>
  <ol>Put the lid on, turn the valve to sealing, and select Manual or Pressure Cook, high pressure, for 3 minutes.</ol>
  <ol>It will take 5-10 minutes to come to pressure and begin counting down. When the cook time is up, turn the Instant Pot off (hit cancel or unplug) and let sit until pressure has completely naturally released (the silver pin will drop and the valve will move easily), or at least 10 minutes.</ol>
  <ol>Remove the lid and serve.</ol>
